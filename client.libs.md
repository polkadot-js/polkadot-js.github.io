- [@polkadot/client-p2p](https://github.com/polkadot-js/client-p2p) A Promised-based API library for interacting with Polkadot network clients. It wraps the RPC layer and handles the encoding and decoding of method calls to and from Polkadot network clients.
- [@polkadot/client-rpc](https://github.com/polkadot-js/client-rpc) A lower-level formatter for API input and output value formatters. Used internally in the API for consistent method calls.
- [@polkadot/types](https://github.com/polkadot-js/types) A collection of useful utility-belt functions, primarily used to make development on these projects consistent with less repetitive boilerplate.
- [@polkadot/wasm](https://github.com/polkadot-js/wasm) Various transport providers e.g. Http, Ws, each with a standard interface. These are passed to the API when instantiating the API library.
