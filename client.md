- [paritytech/substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) Substrate is a platform-level component that has been used as the basis of major projects like Polkadot. It is written in Rust and may serve as both a library for building new "next-generation" Substrate-based blockchains, and as a definitive "skeleton key" of a blockchain client that is able to synchronise to and Substrate-based blockchain in the Polkadot network. It is a WIP and currently includes code to run the Polkadot PoC-2 "Krumme Lanke" testnet and the PoC-3 "BBQ Birch" testnet.
- [paritytech/polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot)
Implementation of a [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/) node in Rust. It is a WIP and currently includes code to run Polkadot PoC-3.
- [@polkadot/client](https://github.com/polkadot-js/client) An early JavaScript implementation of a Polkadot network client. It is not yet anywhere close to a complete state, neither does it support all network features. However it is a developer preview of the ongoing work. It is a WIP and contains numerous internal client library packages listed in the Github Readme.

Note: The work on Substrate and Polkadot is officially sponsored by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), but not affiliated with the JS libraries.
