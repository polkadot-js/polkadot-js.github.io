- [paritytech/polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) The definitive client for the Polkadot network, written in Rust. At this point it is the most complete (although still WIP) client and the work is officially sponsored by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) - so while not affiliated with the JS libraries, it is the go-to-client for the most up-to-date and progressive implementation.
- [@polkadot/client](https://github.com/polkadot-js/client) An early JavaScript implementation of a Polkadot network client. It is not yet anywhere close to a complete state, neither does it support all network features. However it is a developer preview of the ongoing work.
