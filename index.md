- [{.apps}](/apps) User-facing applications that communicate with clients running on the network. Display the status, perform queries on clients, interact with running nodes.
- [{.client}](client.html) An early and incomplete JavaScript implementation of a network client that can communicate with other clients on the network.

## {.welcome}

This is an effort to provide a collection of tools, utilities and libraries for interacting with the [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network) from JavaScript. All code is made available on [Github](https://github.com/polkadot-js/) with a [permissive ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license).

While there is a slant towards developer tools, providing libraries to allow others to build tools on top of, a collection of applications are made available that allows for interaction with the network from a pure user perspective.

This is not an official sponsored project, rather it is a community effort to trial tooling while the network is being developed.

## {.contributing}

Contributions are welcome. Fee free to use the tools and libraries, log issues as you find them or create pull requests for your bug-bears or features.

To get started, take a look at [@polkadot/dev](https://github.com/polkadot-js/dev#readme) which contains the guidelines and styles in addition to the [overall @polkadot project board](https://github.com/orgs/polkadot-js/projects/1) where we track all the issues across the different repositories.

As a new collection of projects, we take quality seriously - library code should be comprehensively [unit tested](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and interfaces should have [full type definitions](https://flow.org/).
