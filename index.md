## {.welcome}

This is an effort to provide a collection of tools, utilities and libraries for interacting with the [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network) from JavaScript. All code is made available on [Github](https://github.com/polkadot-js/) with a [permissive Apache-2.0 license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License#Version_2.0).

While there is a slant towards developer tools, providing libraries to allow others to build tools on top of, a collection of applications are made available that allows for interaction with the network from a pure user perspective.

If you are a end-user looking to interact with the network, you can interact with [Polkadot/Substrate (latest, project hosted)](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) or [Polkadot (stable, Pairity hosted)](https://poc-3.polkadot.io/)

If you are a developer looking at intreracting with the network from your apps, visit the [Polkadot-JS API documentation portal](https://polkadot.js.org/api) to get started with the APIs.

## {.contributing}

This is a community effort to trial tooling while the network is being developed. Contributions are welcome. Feel free to use the tools and libraries, log issues as you find them or create pull requests for your bug-bears or features.

To get started, take a look at the [overall @polkadot project board](https://github.com/orgs/polkadot-js/projects/1) where we track all the issues across the different repositories.

As a new collection of projects, we take quality seriously - library code should be comprehensively [unit tested](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and interfaces should have [full type definitions](http://typescriptlang.org).

## {.media}

You can follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/polkadotjs) to receive latest updates on progress across the projects.
